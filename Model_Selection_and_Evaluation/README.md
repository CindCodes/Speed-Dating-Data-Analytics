# Phase 3: Model Selection and Evaluation
In the third part of this process, we select a few models and evalute their effectiveness. We talk about our data's performance metrics and how they are related to our business problem and how our models can solve it. We briefly describe our models, its inputs and outputs. We provide information on how we create our training and testing dataset and how we implement them. We use data visualization tools to create a digestable performance comparison of our different models. Based on our evaluation, we pick a model for deployment. We perform hyper-parameter optimization to show improvement in model performance.
